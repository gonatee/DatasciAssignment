## Code Book

This will describe the data used in this project.

### Overview

30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements.

### Explanation of each file

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.

* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.

More information about the files is available in `README.txt`. More information about the features is available in `features_info.txt`.

### Data files that were not used

This analysis was performed using only the files above, and did not use the raw signal data. Therefore, the data files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were ignored.

### Processing steps

1. Setting a working folder to download - where the data are located
2. Loading all the TRAIN and TEST set (labels and features included) into data frame
3. Merge the TRAIN and TEST datasets together
4. Pick only mean() and std() and insert proper column name to the merged dataset
5. Replace actiity number with activity name
6. Make 2 variables a factor
7. Write tidy file
